# WALLET TRACKING

## Getting started

This program helps you track token balances of a wallet address. When it detects there is enough balance, it will transfer all of the balance to the new wallet immediately

Use case: Someone stole your seed word / private key and took all the money in your wallet. Fortunately, you still have some tokens locked in the pools. You need to transfer your token to a new wallet  immediately after withdrawing from the pool

## Guide

- Install node.js

- Open file index.js

- Update ``recipient`` and ``privateKey``

- Run command ``node index.js``
